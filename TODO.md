# TODO 

### Technical 

See [project seeds](www.docs.insight-icon.net)

### House Keeping 
- Consistent `tags` naming convention with merge. 
    - Need list of maps 
    - See below

- Resource naming library 
    - This includes every resource that is called, categorized, and documented
        - Rob will setup the variable registry and we'll render it in sphinx 
        - Rob will aggregate all the variables into a single excel sheet and then we can work from there 

- Label 
    - A consistent naming convention to name all the resources based on the context with which they are called
        - Examples
            - s3 buckets 
            - tags 
            - remote state 
                - Already defined but could be a `locals` block in the terraform all the way through
            - account aliases 
            - iam 
            - idp 
            - Reach goals             
                - metrics
                - logs...
            
    - Rob will start this
