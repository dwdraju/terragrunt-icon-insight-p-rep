# AWS Organization 

**WIP** - Be advised 

Immutable deployment of AWS Organization and associated accounts to support a multi-account security posture. 

Setting up new accounts is a pain and involves unaudited manual steps to unseal properly.  The initial design of this 
repo was done manually but in the future, best practices will be codified to unseal new accounts and setup proper 
audit-trails and permissions.
